R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install on R 3.2.3 and
R development version, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and
Win builder.

This submission replaces one import (XML) for another (xml2), adds 
a new function, speeds up some other functions, and fixes some code
to comply with changes in the newest version of the httr package.

Thanks! Scott Chamberlain
