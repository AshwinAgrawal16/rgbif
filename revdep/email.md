Hi,

This is an automated email to let you know about the upcoming release of `rgbif`, which will be submitted to CRAN on 2016-06-26. To check for potential problems, I ran `R CMD check` on your package `{{{your_package}}}` ({{{your_version}}}).

I found no problems on check.

To get the development version of `rgbif` so you can run the checks yourself, you can run:

    # install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("ropensci/rgbif")

To see what's changed visit <https://github.com/ropensci/rgbif/blob/master/NEWS.md>.

If you have any questions about this email, please feel free to respond directly.

Regards,
Scott Chamberlain
